# WebOS Typings Generator

This repository holds code for typings generator for LG WebOS luna services.

I grew frustrated enough with these old school docs that I built a custom generator to extract the html and turn it into d.ts declarations.

The actual generated typings can be seen at [Superd22/webos-typings](https://github.com/Superd22/webos-typings/tree/beta) and installed through `npm i webos-typings`
